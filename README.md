# University Study Room Booking System

This project is to build a study room booking system (including both the frontend app and the backend database) for Fudan University.

The system utilizes the Django framework and the SQLite database to develop a scalable web application for booking study rooms and meeting rooms within a university setting. The app builds responsive interfaces with Bootstrap while keeping it visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.
